Ali was born in Kentucky in 1942. His real name was Cassius Clay. When he was 12, someone stole his bicycle. He was so angry that he told a police officer he wanted to fight the thief. The officer said, "You better learn how to fight first," and took him to a boxing gym.

Ali discovered he was naturally good at boxing. He was fast with his hands and even faster with his feet. He would "float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," as he liked to say. He also loved to talk and would tell everyone he was "the greatest."

Ali won a gold medal at the Olympics when he was 18. He became the heavyweight champion of the world three times. But what made Ali truly special was his courage outside of boxing.

During a war, Ali refused to fight because he believed the war was wrong. This was a very brave thing to do. Many people were angry with him, and he lost his boxing titles. But Ali stood by his beliefs.

Later, people realized Ali was right to stand up for what he believed. He became a symbol of courage and doing what's right, even when it's hard. Ali taught us that being strong means standing up for your beliefs.`,
